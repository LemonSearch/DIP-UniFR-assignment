Assignments of Digital Image Processing at the University of Fribourg

## Contents
### Assignment 1: Flipping Images
In this assignment, you will create a small project that can load an image, apply a simple image transformation, and save it back as a new image. [code](https://github.com/LemonSearch/DIP-UniFR-assignment/blob/main/01_Flipping%20Images.ipynb)
### Assignment 2: Indexed Colors
In this assignment, we ask you to create a program that allows to represent a RGB image with indexed color using a limited number of colors with two different methods. [code](https://github.com/LemonSearch/DIP-UniFR-assignment/blob/main/02_Indexed%20Colors.ipynb)
### Assignment 3: Histogram Equalization
In this assignment, we ask you to write and apply histogram equalization on greyscale images and color images. You will compare the histogram equalization applied to different color representations. [code](https://github.com/LemonSearch/DIP-UniFR-assignment/blob/main/03_Histogram%20Equalization.ipynb)
### Assignment 4: Local Operators
In this assignment, we ask you to implement and apply different local filters. In the first part of this exercise, you will observe the impact of the filter size. In the second part, you will compare two edge detection filters. In the last part, you will experiment with statistical filters. Please note that the input and the output images should always have the same size. [code](https://github.com/LemonSearch/DIP-UniFR-assignment/blob/main/04_Local%20Operators.ipynb)
